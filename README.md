USER STORY:
AS A conosuer of fermented adult beverages
I WANT to search for local brewerys in my city
SO THAT I can find a place to drink and have a good time


ABOUT US
"The Queen City Watering Hole‚Äù APP will help Charlotte residents and newcomers to the Queen City alike find their new favorite watering hole. We want to help everyone from the professionals entertaining clients to old and new friends getting together. This application will allow users to locate a brewery based on their current location. If the user is having a hard time choose a place, the app can provide a random bar to be chosen by the click of a button.


The QC watering hole should:

1.  Allow the user to choose from a list of breweries in the greater Charlotte area with ease
2. Allow the user to see their current location on a map as well as address and travel time to their brewery options
3. Allow the user to give the app permission to choose a random brewery from the list of brewerys on the app


This is the homescreen of the app, user clicks allow in the upper left hand corner for app to register user's location.  User the clicks the "find my beer" button.

App now shows the user a map with their location as well as the pinned locations of the breweries.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Bulma.io-for the layout
google maps api for user location, brewery directions and location
openbrewery DB API for the list of locale breweries


----------------------------------------------------

Challenges: 
The biggest challenges were working with the google api in order to track user location as well as supply the list of breweries in the area.
Another major challenge was having full functionality of the "choose my beer" button to pick a random brewery for the USER
